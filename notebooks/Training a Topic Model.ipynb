Stop words are something we typically want to prevent in our topic representations as they do not give additional information to the topic.

    "- **min_df:**\n",

You can imagine that if we have a million documents and a certain word only appears a single time across all of them, then it would be highly unlikely to be representative of a topic. Typically, the c-TF-IDF calculation removes that word from the topic representation but when you have millions of documents, that will also lead to a very large topic-term matrix. To prevent a huge vocabulary, we can set the min_df to only accept words that have a minimum frequency.\n",

Setting this, for example, to 10_000 creates a topic-term matrix with 10_000 terms. This helps you control the size of the topic-term matrix directly without having to fiddle around with the min_df parameter:"

    "BERTopic offers various representation models that enhance the accuracy and relevance of topic modeling beyond its default Bag-of-Words and c-TF-IDF methods. These models allow for significant fine-tuning of topic representations after initial training, without the need to re-train the model. These are not used by default, and the use of them is mostly for the purposes of understandability.\n",

    "**KeyBERTInspired**\n",
    "- One such model is KeyBERTInspired, which refines topics by leveraging c-TF-IDF to create representative documents for each topic. It then measures the semantic relationships between these documents and potential keywords, enhancing the initial keyword sets based on their relevance and coherence with the topic. This model effectively speeds up the inference process while maintaining a high level of accuracy in keyword representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PartOfSpeech (POS)**\n",
    "- Another model, PartOfSpeech (POS), utilizes part of speech tagging to refine keywords further. It extracts documents containing specific keywords and uses Spacy's POS module to filter and rank these keywords by their c-TF-IDF values. This method helps in identifying more relevant noun phrases and adjectives that better represent the topics.\n",

    "- Finally, Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) reduces redundancy within the keywords. MMR selects diverse and representative keywords by balancing their relevance to the document and their similarity to each other, thereby minimizing overlap and enhancing topic distinctiveness."
